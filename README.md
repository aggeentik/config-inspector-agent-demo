# StreetraceðŸš—ðŸ’¨ Config Inspector Agent Demo

## Summary

Demo scenario shows your Streetrace AI Config Inspector Agent handling a production configuration change.
Config Inspector is an expert AI agent specialized in validating and analyzing configuration changes for complex production systems. 
Its primary mission is to prevent configuration-related outages by performing rigorous analysis before any changes are deployed.

### Demo Context 

E-commerce platform scaling for Black Friday traffic with payment service updates that could impact revenue.

## Agent Flow

1. **Multi-Layer Configuration Validation**

- Syntax Validation: Check YAML, JSON, properties files, and other configuration formats for structural correctness
- Semantic Validation: Analyze configuration values for logical consistency, resource constraints, and best practices
- Cross-Component Impact: Identify how changes in one component may affect dependent services
- Version Compatibility: Verify configuration changes are compatible with target software versions

2. **Historical Pattern Analysis**

- Incident Mining: Search historical incident records for similar configuration changes that caused outages
- Change Pattern Recognition: Identify recurring patterns between configuration modifications and system failures
- Risk Correlation: Calculate probability of failure based on historical data and current system state
- Trend Analysis: Detect configuration drift patterns that may indicate emerging risks

3. **Blast Radius Assessment**

- Direct Impact: Analyze immediate effects on the target component
- Downstream Impact: Trace effects through dependent services and data flows
- Upstream Impact: Identify services that depend on the component being changed
- Resource Contention: Assess potential resource conflicts (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- Cascading Failure Risk: Model potential failure propagation scenarios

4. **Data-Driven Risk Scoring**

- Quantitative Assessment: Assign numerical risk scores (0-10 scale) based on multiple factors
- Confidence Levels: Provide confidence percentages for each risk assessment
- Evidence-Based Reasoning: Link all risk assessments to specific historical data or known patterns
- Business Impact Estimation: Translate technical risks into business terms (user impact, revenue risk, SLA breach probability)
